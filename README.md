# Lohika_JS_Coding_Camp

Entry points:
  - server: npm run server
  - client: npm run client (stay in the app root directory)
  You can also run "npm run dev" - it will start both server and client (one command), however, the messages into console will be messed up, 
    so imo use "npm run server" and "npm run client"
